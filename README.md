pyjq: Binding for jq JSON Processor
===================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/doloopwhile/pyjq.svg?branch=travis-ci)](https://travis-ci.org/doloopwhile/pyjq)

pyjq is a Python bindings for jq (<http://stedolan.github.io/jq/>).

> jq is like sed for JSON data â€“ you can use it to slice and filter and
> map and transform structured data with the same ease that sed, awk,
> grep and friends let you play with text.

You can seamlessly call jq script (like regular expression) and process
plain python data structure.

For your information, <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jq> is a also jq
bindings but different and incompatible with pyjq.

Example
-------

    >>> data = dict(
    ...     parameters= [
    ...         dict(name="PKG_TAG_NAME", value="trunk"),
    ...         dict(name="GIT_COMMIT", value="master"),
    ...         dict(name="TRIGGERED_JOB", value="trunk-buildall")
    ...     ],
    ...     id="2013-12-27_00-09-37",
    ...     changeSet=dict(items=[], kind="git"),
    ... )
    >>> import pyjq
    >>> pyjq.first('.parameters[] | {"param_name": .name, "param_type":.type}', data)
    {'param_type': None, 'param_name': 'PKG_TAG_NAME'}

API
---

For jq script, [see its manual](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/).

Only four APIs are provided. They are `apply`, `one`, `first`,
`compile`.

`apply(script, value, **kw)`
:   Transform object by jq script, returning all results as list.

`first(script, value, default=None, **kw)`
:   Transform object by jq script, returning the first result. Return
    default if result is empty.

`one(script, value, **kw)`
:   Transform object by jq script, returning the first result. Raise
    ValueError unless results does not include exactly one element.

`compile(script, **kw)`
:   Compile a jq script, retuning a script object.

Limitation
----------

jq is a JSON Processor. Therefore pyjq is able to process only "JSON
compatible" data (object made only from str, int, float, list, dict).

### Build jq

You have to build and install jq library before you build this module.

jq requires following packages:

-   Flex
-   Bison
-   GCC
-   Make
-   Autotools

These will be installed by your system's package manager (apt, yum, or
else).

Checkout source code from github. Build and install jq:

    git clone https://github.com/stedolan/jq
    cd jq
    autoreconf -i
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

Some system have cached list of dynamic link libraries. In such system,
library of jq is not loaded and importing python binding fails.

Command to refresh the cache is system specific. In the case Linux Mint
14:

    ldconfig

### Install pyjq

You can install from PyPI by usual way.

    pip install pyjq

If you would like to build from source, you have to generate C source
code by *cython* before run `setup.py`.

    cython _pyjq.pyx
    python setup.py install

Q&A
---

### How can I process json string got from API by pyjq?

You should apply `json.loads` in the standard library before pass to
pyjq.
